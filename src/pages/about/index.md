## Education as Purpose

The school & board exist to help students, teachers & staff facilitate an education to prepare students to engage meaningfully with their community. I view all decisions first from the lens of, "how does this help the school serve the community?"



## Pragmatic Rigor

We should be passionate in our purpose & dispassionate in our plans, always with an eye on the good we can achieve with our resources. I commit to rigor in my advocacy, & to seek information, ideas & advice when facts are sparse.



## The Virtue of Value

I believe in investing resources to achieve results with value. Public education is a public endeavor, not a commercial exercise, & should be funded according to the mission. Resources managed wisely to achieve the most good, not only to reduce cost.



## The Value of Virtue

Justice, diversity, equity, inclusion, health, kindnessâ€”all of these are worthy pursuits of a community in their own right. As a member of the District 121 School Board, I will seek to uphold & promote these values & see our institutions do the same.
