  title: Why Blake?
  description: >
    Our school district has been mismanaged. Over the years our finances have
    deteriorated to the point of crisis, and most recently with the COVID-19
    pandemic, but also in terms of the lack of alignment on priorities between
    the school board and members of the community most directly impacted, namely
    students, parents and educators. As a member of the community, I have for
    years been a consistent advocate for better management, but my conscience
    has pushed me to seek a more active role.

        *Education as Purpose* The school & board exist to help students,
        teachers & staff facilitate an education to prepare students to engage
        meaningfully with their community. I view all decisions first from the
        lens of, "how does this help the school serve the community?"

        *Pragmatic Rigor* We should be passionate in our purpose & dispassionate
        in our plans, always with an eye on the good we can achieve with our
        resources. I commit to rigor in my advocacy, & to seek information,
        ideas & advice when facts are sparse.

        *The Virtue of Value* I believe in investing resources to achieve
        results with value. Public education is a public endeavor, not a
        commercial exercise, & should be funded according to the mission.
        Resources managed wisely to achieve the most good, not only to reduce
        cost.

        *The Value of Virtue* Justice, diversity, equity, inclusion, health,
        kindnessâ€”all of these are worthy pursuits of a community in their own
        right. As a member of the District 121 School Board, I will seek to
        uphold & promote these values & see our institutions do the same.
