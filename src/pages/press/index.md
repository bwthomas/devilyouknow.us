  <p>
    <i>"I kindly implore you to face what Grayslake, Mundelein, many other
    districts across this state and country have grappled with. Your teachers
    will tell you, and medical science concur, a return to the classroom will
    not be or feel safe. You will not improve students’ mental health,
    engagement, or ability to succeed because they will not be or feel safe"</i>

  <p>
    <i>Q. How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide
    leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents -- even ones with
    whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities?</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>A. All three of those, frankly in exactly that order. Leaders must be
    prepared to make choices in the best interest of the community irrespective
    of their popularity and, in turn, ultimately accept the consequences of
    those decisions, which may well mean losing an election. They should
    certainly be thoughtful and receptive to voices in the community, but must
    be clear minded in choosing a path for the good of students, teachers and
    the community rather than their own approval rating.</i>

    <i>"First-time candidate Blake Thomas first started considering joining the
    school board around 2015, when former District 121 Board of Education member
    Liz Biondi said she did not want the district to hire a gay superintendent
    [...] One of his primary issues with how the district is functioning is that
    the district began to allow students, teachers and staff back into school
    too early."</i>
